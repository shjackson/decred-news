June's highlights:

- { mobile apps v1.5 release }
- { chain analysis insights by rr }

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

- extracted [interfaces](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2211) in `rpcserver` to allow mocking and added tests for some of its handlers
- fixed [mempool](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2232) view construction when dealing with disapproved blocks { what did the bug cause in practice? }
- fixed crashes on RPC server edge cases with crafted JSON ([one](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2218), [another](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2221))
- [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2222) Encrypt and Decrypt functions to discourage their use and instead recommend to use modern encryption scheme (e.g. [AEAD ciphers](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/27248))

In progress:

- [asynchronous](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2219) indexing
- { anything to say about decentralize treasury WIP? https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2170 }

Addressing concerns about project timeline, @chappjc noted:

> Mainnet beta will be this summer. Dev plan is to do that by end of Q2 2020, and we are. Also, the client browser interface was barely hinted at in the dev proposal and we dramatically expanded the scope of the project to make it happen and look good.
> 
> LTC and generic BTC-clone support wasn't part of the prop, but we got that done too.
> 
> We also conceived a new epoch matching algorithm based on cryptographic commitments from the clients, the preimages for which are revealed at epoch close, and completely reimplemented it half way through the project. Not easy or quick, but it's done too and it's a big improvement over the original spec. ([2020-06-01](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15910318461825cyXfI:decred.org))

## Governance

In June the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 12,629 DCR and spent 8,340 DCR. Using June's daily average DCR/USD rate of $16.05, this is $203K received and $134K spent. At May's average daily rate of $14.11, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $118K. As of Jul 1, Treasury balance is 633,820 DCR (9.08 million USD at $14.32).

Six proposals were voted on in June, with 4 approved and 2 rejected, with relatively high turnout for these proposals as compared to some recent proposals that . The proposals to be approved were:

* Decred OnChain - A Research and Charting Resource - 86% approval (38% turnout)
* Decred Latam Marketing and Events Proposal 2 - 61% approval (41% turnout)
* DCR On-Chain Research: Phase 2 - 74% approval (31% turnout)
* Decred Bug Bounty Program: Phase 3 - 98% approval (32% turnout)

The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4affceb07f5b8126366e8b73ed3d164ebc010bc6fefba19375c4c2e2b252beb0) to sponsor a book (CoinStory) for $500 was rejected with 11.6% approval and 34% turnout, while the TV marketing [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/9eaafc20f206776e38642e272233390f351c5562c3835369a558cc7d7e341018) had 8% approval and 29% turnout.

Politeia Digest issue [#32](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue032/) has further details on all of the above.

A new [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/df11d7ac85061e6a02d6503555e585a1a37fffd82101eeea14670537c951926f) from @ivandecredfan for Russian content production was published in Jun and started voting in July. @ivandecredfan submitted a similar [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/92e3f2176b332c1aea5887acd2324c2cd730ec450e563df52ddae9d5927d5d36) in Feb which was rejected with 21% approval, but stuck with his video production and took some feedback from commenters on the first proposal on board.

A proposal has been submitted which suggests choosing a new name for the project ("Bitcoin Evolution"). The Politeia admins indicated that the proposal owner (@decredinator) should add a budget and implementation plan before the proposal would be considered valid for publication on the proposals site. @decredinator [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hh2ult/a_better_name_for_decred_to_broaden_the_reach_of/) the proposal to reddit so that the community can read it and contribute to making it a reality. Most of the comments are not keen on the idea. @decredinator has also been [called out](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hh2ult/a_better_name_for_decred_to_broaden_the_reach_of/fwbfmst/ ) for spamming the link to this post across a range of unrelated tweets.

Hashrate: [June's hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month. Pool [hashrate distribution](https://dcrstats.com/pow) as of {date} (approximate): {pool name n%, ...}.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was {n.n, try to snapshot it on 1st} DCR (+{n.n}). The [price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=t1-t2&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR. [Locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, which corresponded to {n.n}-{n.n}% of the available supply [participating](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=t1-t2&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in PoS.

{ hint: second source for locked %: https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000003/proof-of-stake?orgId=1&from=now-40d&to=now }

{recap of ticket price action if it was interesting}

{ hint: consider keeping Block size and Transactions sections every 2nd or 3rd month, unless there is something interesting to report }

Block size: This month, the blockchain size grew by {n} MB. [Block size](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} varied between {n.n}-{n.n} with an average of {n.n} KB. {any interesting fact about this month's blocks}

Transactions: In June, Decred users made {n} regular transactions and bought {n} tickets. {n} tickets were rewarded for voting and {n} were revoked. On average, there were {n} regular DCR transactions and {n} new tickets per day.

An unusual spike of block size usage (unrelated to large Treasury payout transactions) occurred on May 29-31. Dozens of nearly full [blocks](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=453840&rows=50) were mined with 90-100 KB transactions which consolidated lots of tiny outputs into 6 DCR outputs. On May 31 the blockchain grew by a [record](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=block-size&bin=day&axis=time) 13 MB, compared to an average growth of 4 MB/day. It [looks like](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15913552414776FisdN:decred.org) a VSP was consolidating ticket fees. Many of the 6 DCR outputs were later [merged](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/tx/ef562befa1f8eeee6250d98b6ccb1722b8fba508dd4919d5b85139df9c761e0c) into a pile {rr: a pile of credits? do they stack? lol} of ~240K DCR (~3.4M USD, ~2% supply), known to be associated with a popular cryptocurrency exchange. tl;dr a VSP operator sent about 200 DCR (voting fees paid by users of the VSP) to an exchange, it used a lot of block space because it involved thousands of tiny fee payments associated with individual tickets processed by that VSP.

{ hint: for dcr.farm set the zoom to show exactly UTC month 1st 00:00:00 - next month 1st 00:00:00 }

Nodes: Throughout [June](https://charts.dcr.farm/d/000000014/nodes?orgId=1&from=1590969600000&to=1593561600000) there was an average of {} public listening nodes and {} total nodes per dcr.farm. Version distribution: {vx.y.z: n% (+n%), ...}.

@richardred published [part 1](https://blockcommons.red/post/dcr-on-chain-1/) in a series about analysing Decred's blockchain data, highlights including:

- 465K of the 840K [founders premine](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/premine/#bring-up-costs) remains untouched
- 290K of the 840K [airdrop](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/premine/#airdrop) coins did not move as well
- ~27% of the 345K DCR paid by the Treasury to contractors was not touched since the contractor received it, ~24% was staked, ~24% ended up in a known exchange address, ~1.7% was mixed
- out of ~5.8M DCR PoW rewards, 60% ended up on addresses associated with exchanges, 10% has been staked, and the rest is unspent (6%) or has unknown outcome (24%). 

The same kind of analysis was repeated with fresh data and formatting improvements for [Issue 27](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-issue-27) of Our Network.

## Integrations

{ hint: new pieces of infrastructure or updates from existing: VSPs, exchanges, wallets, OTC desks, payment processors. use bullets or paragraphs, whatever looks best in a given month's compilation }

- Hotbit [announced](https://medium.com/@hotbit/hotbits-announcement-regarding-the-launch-of-dcr-investment-product-and-current-deposit-221400da20dd) a Decred investment product on Jun 11, with an annualized return of 4.27% and "redemption period being (T+30)". There is a minimum purchase of 100 DCR and it seems like the "minimum unit for the calculation of interests of current deposit investment plan will be 1DCR", whatever that means. There is a link for further details, which might have also clarified another puzzling mention of a 0.24% rate, but the link is dead.

- DecredVoting VSP [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hbofz4/tired_of_keeping_track_of_your_staking_activities/) a new tickets analytics dashboard which shows the VSPs users stats about their tickets, including some specific to split tickets devised by @decreddave himself which are not available elsewhere.

> The only thing holding Decred back in my honest opinion is more people coming up with creative ways to shout about it. It is all this thing needs. Because once you get the level of attention, the fundamentals just speak for themselves.

Decred videos are now also posted [on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/decred/) as a fallback in case anything happens to the YouTube channel. This is good timing since as expected earlier, YouTube [removed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/youtubes-algorithm-is-punishing-crypto-content-and-no-one-knows-why) a bunch of crypto videos during the COVID-19 wrongthink cleanup.

There has been some controversy about a [bug](https://medium.com/blockstream/patching-the-liquid-timelock-issue-b4b2f5f9a973) with Blockstream's Liquid service whereby the "emergency backup keys" held by Blockstream were repeatedly taking custody of funds in a way that should only have happened in an emergency. The controversey is largely around how the disclosure of the bug has been handled, with James Prestwich (who discovered it) not [impressed](https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1277090512126660608) by the way its severity has been downplayed by Blockstream. This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/hhwwcb/vulnerability_discovered_in_liquid_allowing/fwdqbxc) on /r/cryptocurrency has a good timeline, including an observation that the story was not being covered on /r/bitcoin.

Reddit have opened a [call](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) for ideas about how they might scale the recently launched points system (currently running on Ethereum's Rinkeby testnet) to the whole platform.

The cost of transactions on Ethereum has [increased by 500%](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-developers-consider-new-fee-model-as-gas-costs-climb) since April and developers are looking at ways to bring this down, including an EIP (1559) which would see users pay a "base fee" to the network plus a tip to miners when making transactions.

One Ethereum user has been paying [particularly](https://www.coindesk.com/whale-sent-130-ether-transaction-fee) high fees this month, with two separate transactions each paying $2.6 million worth of ETH as a transaction fee to miners, for a transfer of a small amount of ETH (~$100). Speculation about the cause of the high fees included mistakes and [blackmail](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1271463564440678401?s=20) attempts. Adding to the mystery, the pool which mined one of the transactions appeared to [offer](https://twitter.com/sparkpool_eth/status/1270688700968480768) to return some of the fee, but nobody came forward. 

Zcash expenses Q4 2019 https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1276575095809617922 {rr: I think we covered their expenses and transparency report once before, hard to know where to draw the line on these as there are now quite a few projects which produce them and ZEC are doing one per quarter... imo the first one is more noteworthy, then subsequent reports tend to report slightly more or less of whatever was in the first report}

A [bug](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bancors-bug-exposes-dangerously-common-practice-in-ethereum-defi) with the Bancor smart contracts was detected which would have allowed attackers to drain the funds of anyone who interacted with it, so "Bancor acted preemptively to 'steal' user funds before malicious parties could intervene". The severity of the problem was compounded by the use of "infinite approvals", which save on transaction fees and offer a better UX, but expose users to much more risk (in this case the potential attacker could get all of the depositor's tokens, not just the amount they chose to deposit). Use of infinite approvals is common to many DeFi apps.

- Bancor "smart contracts" https://cointelegraph.com/news/bancors-bug-exposes-dangerously-common-practice-in-ethereum-defi { pretty horrifying practice that again shows that very rich smart contracts is playing with fire, but is it relevant enough for Decred/DEX enough? rr: I think this is totally relevant, DeFi complexity and the messes it causes are relevant to Decred because there are people who want to do it with DCR!}

{other: regulations, privacy, security, fun}

Chainalysis [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chainalysis-can-now-track-your-privacy-coins-zcash-dash) the support of Zcash and Dash privacy coins in their products. Vast majority of transactions in these networks can be traced because privacy features are used by very few people. This comes after the May's news of several exchanges [delisting](https://cointelegraph.com/news/another-exchange-delists-monero-amidst-ongoing-sex-scandal) Monero because it is better at protecting users' privacy, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University claiming they can trace 99%+ Zcash and 30% Monero transactions{need a source for the last bit}.
