> The only thing holding Decred back in my honest opinion is more people coming up with creative ways to shout about it. It is all this thing needs. Because once you get the level of attention, the fundamentals just speak for themselves.

Decred videos are now also posted [on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/decred/) as a fallback in case anything happens to the YouTube channel. This is good timing since as expected earlier, YouTube [removed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/youtubes-algorithm-is-punishing-crypto-content-and-no-one-knows-why) a bunch of crypto videos during the COVID-19 wrongthink cleanup.

## Community Discussions

Comm systems news:

- Decred's Discord server has been restructured and channels have been grouped into 3 categories: Discord-only channels for a more casual experience compared to Matrix (where many rooms are used as virtual offices to coordinate work), read-only channels bridged to Matrix (as a balance between transparency and productivity in Matrix rooms), and fully bridged rooms #decred-101, #proposals, #support, #ticket-splitting and #trading. { @Exitus anything to add? }
- { new Telegram support channel https://t.me/DecredSupport bridged to Matrix #support }

{relevant exchanges and websites}

[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) partnered with Hacken to add [cybersecurity](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coingecko-adds-crypto-exchanges-cybersecurity-ratings-to-trust-score) ratings for exchanges listed on the site (see Trust Score tab).

{other: regulations, privacy, security, fun}

Chainalysis [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chainalysis-can-now-track-your-privacy-coins-zcash-dash) the support of Zcash and Dash privacy coins in their products. Vast majority of transactions in these networks can be traced because privacy features are used by very few people. This comes after the May's news of several exchanges [delisting](https://cointelegraph.com/news/another-exchange-delists-monero-amidst-ongoing-sex-scandal) Monero because it is better at protecting users' privacy, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University claiming they can trace 99%+ Zcash and 30% Monero transactions.
